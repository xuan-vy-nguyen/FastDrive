To explain:
- Feature branch: each member receive a task and then, he will check a feature branch from Develop. He code, debug, and do everything he want to in here. After finish his task, that man should create a pull request and invite another teammates for reviewing  before merging.
- Develop branch: We test morething in here before submitting to Master branch. Each feature can work with themselves but after merging a lot of components in one source, They will certainly conflict or have bugs. Develop branch is using for fixing those bugs. 
- Master branch: Not only is what we submit, but it alse is the most beautiful source on Github - no bug, clean code.
